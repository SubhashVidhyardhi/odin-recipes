        <li>First rinse both methi leaves and palak leaves in water very well. Drain all the water. Use a colander or strainer while rinsing. You will need 3.5 cups methi leaves and ⅔ to ¾ cup roughly chopped spinach leaves.</li><br>

        <li>With the help of pasta tongs, lift the blanched leaves. place the blanched leaves in cold water. Keep the leaves in cold water for 1 minute.Again using pasta tongs place the leaves in a blender or grinder jar.</li>
        <li>Without adding any water blend to a smooth puree. Keep aside.Take 2 tablespoons mustard oil in a pan or kadai. Reduce the heat to a low and let the mustard oil begin to smoke.</li><br>
        <li> Add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 inch cinnamon and 3 cloves.Let the spices splutter.Add the spices and mix very well.Add the methi-palak puree. Then switch on the heat and keep it to a low.</li><br>
        <li>Season with 2 teaspoons sugar and salt as per taste.Add ½ to ⅔ cup water or add as required. You can make the gravy thick or like palak paneer consistency by adding less or more water. The addition of ½ cup water will give a slightly thick gravy in this recipe.</li><br>
        <li>Mix the cream with the remaining gravy.Add paneer cubes. You can even fry paneer cubes in 1 to 2 tablespoons oil and then add.Mix and then switch off the heat.</li><br>
        <li>Lastly crush ¼ teaspoon kasuri methi. Adding kasuri methi gives a good aroma to the dish. But you can skip if you do not have kasuri methi leaves. Mix again.Serve methi chaman curry hot with roti or naan or paratha or tandoori roti. It also taste good with cumin rice or saffron rice or steamed basmati rice.</li>
